# 2048_game
This is our 2048 game, created by Angelina Chen and Edward Dong. This game contains multiple components, including a title page, a main menu, and the actual game board. There were many classes that were needed to successfully code the program, including a Squares class that determined the logistics of each tile, the MainGrid class that determined the logic of the game, the MainGame class which contains the GUI and brings it all together, and much more.
